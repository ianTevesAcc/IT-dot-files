# IT dot files
This is a repo full of my dot files. Copy all files into a folder then move them individually.

```terminal
mkdir ian-dot-files
git clone git@github.com:ianTevesAcc/dot-files.git
```

Then move individually either with a file explorer application or by terminal commands.

```terminal
# move them
mv selected-dot-file selected-directory

# or copy them to their destination
cp selected-dot-file selected-directory
```
